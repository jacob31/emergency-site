## Matthew 5:3-12, Hebrew Gospels from Sepharad

Blessed are the humble ones of spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Yahweh.
Blessed are those who weep for the weeping ones.
Blessed are the resting ones, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they will be satisfied and will become satisfied ones.
Blessed are the compassionate ones, for they will obtain compassion.
Blessed are the pure ones of heart, for they will see Yahweh.
Blessed are the men of shalom, for they will be called the sons of Yahweh.
Blessed are those who bear the persecutions because of righteousness, for theirs will be the heavenly kingdom. 
Blessed ones you will be when the men curse you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil things against you, and lie – because of me. 
Shout with joy – your wages are great in the heavens, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
