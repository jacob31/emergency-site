## Beattitudes 
Matthew 5:3-12, Hebrew Gospels from Sepharad

* Blessed are the humble ones of spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of YHWH.
* Blessed are those who weep for the weeping ones.
* Blessed are the resting ones, for they will inherit the earth.
* Blessed are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they will be satisfied and will become satisfied ones.
* Blessed are the compassionate ones, for they will obtain compassion.
* Blessed are the pure ones of heart, for they will see YHWH.
* Blessed are the men of shalom, for they will be called the sons of YHWH.
* Blessed are those who bear the persecutions because of righteousness, for theirs will be the heavenly kingdom. 
* Blessed ones you will be when the men curse you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil things against you, and lie – because of me. Shout with joy – your wages are great in the heavens, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
